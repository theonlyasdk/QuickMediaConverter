# Quick Media Converter
 Quickly convert between different audio formats. This application uses FFmpeg to convert audio files into MP3, WAV and FLAC. Currently only batch operations are supported (conversion of multiple files inside a folder).
 
## TODO:
- [] Add support to convert single files
- [] Allow user to set advanced options (bitrate, embed metadata, etc.)
