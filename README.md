 Quickly convert between different audio formats. This application uses FFmpeg to convert audio files into MP3, WAV and FLAC. 
 At the moment, only batch operations are supported (conversion of multiple files inside a folder).

## Features
- Extract audio from mp4/mov/avi into wav/mp3/flac
- Convert from any audio format (supported by FFmpeg) into mp3/wav/flac
- Advanced options for conversion (bitrate/sample rate/audio channels)
